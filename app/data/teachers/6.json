    "about": "Hello, my name is Eran & I am a friendly native English speaker. I am an experienced English teacher with a neutral accent that is easily understood. This is because I have grown up living in 13 countries across 4 continents. They include England, America, Australia & Japan. Presently, I live in Lisbon, Portugal. While I am primarily focused on 1 to 1 tuition, I’ve previously taught classes with as many as 50 students at a time. My students have ranged from 12 to 70 years old. From Israeli middle schoolers all the way through to Thai Government officials. As a result, I’ve learned a wide variety of teaching methods. Currently, I'm taking students with English level: B2 onwards, as well as those who are interested in long-term growth and multiple lessons.I understand how hard it can be to learn another language. That's why my teaching style is fun, constructive & easy-going. Lessons will be tailored to meet your needs & goals. Through my lessons, you will gain the confidence to speak English in your daily life.",
