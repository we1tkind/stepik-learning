    "about": "Hi guys, My name is Andrew and I am an English teacher from the USA currently living now in Atlanta, Georgia.My teaching experience ranges from 1 on 1 to groups, children to adults, in-person or online. IMPORTANT*** Although I have experience teaching Children, right now I'm only teaching Adults through Conversational English. This is my specialty and I do this through focusing mainly on Accent Reduction, Pronunciation, Speech Therapy, and improving one's Vocabulary.I have been traveling and teaching since 2008 and my travels have really helped me be more culturally aware, and relevant. I am fun and unique when it comes to teaching English, you won't that find my classes anywhere else.",
