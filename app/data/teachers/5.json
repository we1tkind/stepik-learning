    "about": "Hello! My name is Yang and for more than five years I have been teaching English. I spent part of this time in China, where I worked with students from 3 to 40 years old. I deal with both adults and children. But for all ages, I try to make my classes fun and interactive. Teaching English to me is not just a language lesson. I always try to attract a wider cultural and historical context that helps my students understand more about the language and its features. A degree in history helps me a lot to create such an intellectual environment in the classroom.For each student, I develop an individual curriculum that depends on its goals and needs.",
